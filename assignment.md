## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```

Scum is an agile project management framework suited for small teams experienced in Agile, where your final product is
constantly changing due to stakeholders modifying the scope, and you need to anticipate any kind of changes during project,
and rapidly deploy the product.

Scum aims to establish small pieces of a release faster in sprints, that last 1 to 4 weeks, so you have a working software
to show as team works toward the final product version. Scum uses an empirical approach, meaning working based on facts,
experience, and evidence, where progress is based on observations of reality (working software), instead of guessed plans
based on large amount of upfront requirements that do no reflect reality at the end. One key advantage is that Scum allows
visibility with regards to the progress of work and team via daily stand-up meetings, so that those responsible for it can
be recognized and appreciated for their efforts, which promotes a motivated healthy team.

Daily stand-up makes clear everyone's task, eliminating many misunderstandings and confusion. It ensures team is aware of
all issues and changes as soon as they arise, so issues are identified in advance, allowing teams to resolve them early
before it leads to a bigger issue, saving time and resources and improve quality. By coding and testing features in smaller
releases, there is continuous feedback during daily stand-up, and mistakes can be corrected early on, saving resources and
increasing productivity. Short sprints and constant feedback make it easier to accommodate changes.

Ceremonies like sprint review and sprint retrospective at the end of each sprint makes team reflect on what works well, what
can be improved, and decide on what can be implemented sustainability, improving productivity as team would less likely make
mistakes and have to fix codes.



Notes:
Scum is about 3 pillars; transparency, inspection, adaptation.

Transparency is realized in the tools and rituals of
- Product backlog, task boards, burndown charts, daily stand-up, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives, definition of done.

Inspection and Adaptation are realized in the rituals and ceremonies of
- Inspection: use of Scrum board, create prioritized product backlog, conduct release planning process, collection of feedback from customer and other stakeholders during the Develop Epic(s), inspection and approval of the deliverables by product owner, customer in the Demonstrate and Validate Sprint process.
- Adaptation: daily stand-up/scum meetings, sprint review, sprint retrospective

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
Your answers here

As a user, I want to securely login my account, so that my account and personal details are not compromised.
As a user, I want to find out if this book is available for borrowing in this library
As a user, I want to find out all the libraries where my target book is available for borrowing, so that I know which library to go to borrow the book I want.

As a librarian, I want to easily see the entire catalog available, so that I can answer customer's enqueries on available books.
As a librarian, I want to have access to user accounts, so that I can check if user has reached borrowing limit or help in registering books to be borrowed if the borrowing machine is down.
As a librarian, I want my books' data to be organised according to the library classification system we are using, so that we are using an organizing system we are used to instead of spending resources to learn a new system.
As a librarian, I want to provide useful insights on what books or genres are popular among users, so that I know what and how to improve our library's catalog of books.

As a system engineer, I want the server and networking to be working well, so that the operations are not disrupted.
As a database administrator, I want to ensure that the data structure and design are appropriate, sustainable, and well-maintained, so that it will support developers in building a well-functioning web application.
As a library marketing manager, I want to be able to broadcast my marketing materials for upcoming events and host registration online, so that I can engage my target audience as much as possible.
